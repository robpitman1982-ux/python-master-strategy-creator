## 2026-03-18 — Session 4: Structured logging + cloud launcher fix

**What was done**:
- Created `modules/progress.py` — ProgressTracker class with timestamped log lines and status.json output
- Integrated ProgressTracker into master_strategy_engine.py pipeline — all stage transitions and sweep/refinement progress now logged
- Added optional `progress_callback` parameter to sweep and refinement functions (backward compatible)
- Fixed `run_cloud_job.py` start_engine timeout issue (was 60s, now handles nohup startup properly)
- status.json written to each dataset's output directory, updated every 10% of sweep/refinement progress

**Output changes vs Session 3**:
- Log output now has structured timestamps and stage prefixes
- `Outputs/ES_60m/status.json` created during runs — instant progress check via `cat status.json`
- run_cloud_job.py can now start the engine without SSH timeout errors

**Verified**:
- ProgressTracker unit test passed (manual quick test)
- All imports OK
- Existing pipeline behaviour unchanged (progress_callback is optional)

**Next session priorities**:
1. Run updated engine on new DigitalOcean droplet to test structured logging
2. Analyze results from current cloud run (still in progress on 209.38.86.189)
3. Expand to additional ES timeframes (5m, 15m, 30m, daily)
4. Design master leaderboard aggregator for multi-dataset runs

## 2026-03-17 — Session 3: Cloud deployment preparation

**What was done**:
- Created `Dockerfile` (python:3.11-slim based, gcc/g++ for numpy/pandas)
- Created `requirements.txt` (numpy, pandas, pyyaml)
- Created `.dockerignore` (excludes Data/, Outputs/, .git, pycache, etc.)
- Created `cloud/run_cloud.sh` — bash script: create droplet → upload → build Docker → run → download results → destroy
- Created `cloud/run_cloud.ps1` — PowerShell equivalent for Windows
- Created `cloud/config_full_es.yaml` — full ES 60m sweep config (all 3 families, 5 candidates to refine, 7 workers)
- Created `cloud/config_quick_test.yaml` — quick single-family (mean_reversion) test config
- Created `cloud/SETUP.md` — DigitalOcean setup guide with doctl install, SSH key setup, droplet size/cost reference
- Added `--config` CLI argument to `master_strategy_engine.py` via argparse
- Config is now reloaded from CLI arg in `__main__`, re-deriving all module-level constants
- Added `cloud_results/` to `.gitignore`
- Region set to `syd1` (Sydney — closest to Melbourne) in all scripts

**Cloud workflow**:
1. `run_cloud.ps1` creates a c-8 droplet in syd1
2. Uploads code + data via SCP/rsync
3. Builds Docker image on droplet
4. Runs pipeline inside container with config mounted
5. Downloads results to `cloud_results/<droplet-name>/`
6. Destroys droplet
Total estimated cost: $0.30-0.50 per full ES run on c-8

**Next session priorities**:
1. Test Docker build locally: `docker build -t strategy-engine .`
2. First cloud test run: `.\cloud\run_cloud.ps1 -ConfigFile cloud\config_quick_test.yaml`
3. Export additional TradeStation data (ES 5m/15m/30m/daily, CL, NQ)
4. Create multi-instrument config and run

## 2026-03-17 — Session 2: Config, consistency, multi-dataset

**What was done**:
- Created `config.yaml` — single source of truth for all pipeline constants (datasets, engine, gates, oos_split_date)
- Created `modules/config_loader.py` — `load_config()` and `get_nested()` helpers; falls back to hardcoded defaults if yaml missing
- Updated `master_strategy_engine.py` to load all settings from config (CSV path, workers, leaderboard gates, EngineConfig fields)
- Created `modules/consistency.py` — `analyse_yearly_consistency()`: yearly PnL aggregation, pct_profitable_years, max_consecutive_losing_years, consistency_flag (CONSISTENT/MIXED/INCONSISTENT/INSUFFICIENT_DATA)
- Integrated consistency into `engine.results()` — three new return fields: Pct Profitable Years, Max Consecutive Losing Years, Consistency Flag
- Factored consistency into `calculate_quality_score()` as 6th component (weight 0.15); adjusted other weights to still sum to 1.0
- Propagated new fields through all 3 strategy type sweep result dicts and `RefinementResult`/`_run_refinement_case()` in refiner.py
- Added `oos_split_date` field to `EngineConfig` dataclass; replaced hardcoded `"2019-01-01"` in engine.py results()
- Updated `portfolio_evaluator.py`: `calculate_metrics_split()` and `evaluate_portfolio()` now accept `oos_split_date` parameter
- Updated `__main__` block in master_strategy_engine.py: iterates over `datasets` list from config; calls new `_run_dataset()` helper; each dataset gets its own output subdir (`Outputs/ES_60m/`, etc.)
- Fixed Unicode/emoji output issue in config_loader.py for Windows cp1252 terminals

**Output changes vs Session 1**:
- Config loading prints "[OK] Loaded config from config.yaml" at startup
- Results now include consistency_flag, pct_profitable_years, max_consecutive_losing_years
- quality_score weights slightly adjusted (consistency now 0.15, others reduced proportionally)
- Output directory structure changed: `Outputs/ES_60m/` instead of `Outputs/` flat
- Dataset header printed before each run: "DATASET 1/1: ES 60m"

**Verified**:
- All imports OK, smoke test passed (engine.results() returns all new fields correctly)
- consistency module tested with mock trades: CONSISTENT/INCONSISTENT/INSUFFICIENT_DATA all correct

**Next session priorities**:
1. Cloud deployment prep: Dockerfile, requirements.txt, run scripts
2. Walk-forward validation as alternative to fixed IS/OOS split
3. Bayesian/Optuna optimization for refinement grid (replace brute-force 256-point grid)
4. Actual full pipeline run to verify end-to-end with new directory structure

## 2026-03-16 — Session 1: Foundation hardening

**What was done**:
- Added `quality_score` (0.0–1.0 continuous metric) to `engine.py` results; weighted on avg PF strength, IS/OOS balance, trade count confidence, recent PF, OOS trade presence
- Added `BORDERLINE` suffix detection: any ROBUST/STABLE/MARGINAL flag within 0.05 of a threshold boundary gets `_BORDERLINE` appended
- Propagated `quality_score` through sweep results (all 3 strategy types) and `RefinementResult` dataclass in `refiner.py`
- Capped promotion gate at max 20 candidates using composite ranking (quality_score × 0.4 + oos_pf × 0.3 + trades/yr × 0.3)
- Added `estimate_compute_budget()` — prints eval count and estimated minutes before sweep and refinement
- Added `deduplicate_promoted_candidates()` — removes near-duplicates by matching total_trades + PnL within 1%

**Output changes vs baseline**:
- Trend family: was 93 promoted → now capped at 20
- BORDERLINE flags will appear on strategies near PF thresholds
- Compute budget printed before each sweep and refinement stage
- Dedup report printed after promotion gate

**Next session priorities**:
1. Walk-forward validation as alternative to fixed IS/OOS split
2. Make dataset path configurable (prep for multi-timeframe)
3. Add yearly consistency check (flag strategies that lose money >60% of years)
4. Consider Bayesian optimization (Optuna) for refinement grid

## 2026-03-16 — Session 0: Project review and workflow setup

**What happened**:
- Full pipeline review with Claude (claude.ai project chat)
- Analyzed first run outputs: trend (REGIME_DEPENDENT), MR (STABLE), breakout (BROKEN_IN_OOS)
- Identified key issues: quality flag boundary logic, loose promotion gate, brute-force refinement grid
- Created CLAUDE.md for session continuity
- Created this CHANGELOG_DEV.md
- Established GitHub commit workflow

**Key findings from first run**:
- ES 60m data: 107,149 bars, 2008-01-02 to 2026-03-04
- Trend: 672 combos → 93 promoted → best refined PF 1.13, IS PF 0.83 (below 1.0), OOS PF 1.71
- MR: 792 combos → 27 promoted → best refined PF 1.42, IS PF 1.09, OOS PF 1.86
- Breakout: 582 combos → 37 promoted → best refined PF 0.82, BROKEN_IN_OOS
- Correlation between trend & MR: -0.0005 (excellent)

**Next session priorities**:
1. Fix quality flag boundary logic (make continuous/scored)
2. Tighten promotion gate or add secondary screening
3. Add compute budget estimator
4. Add filter-combo deduplication before refinement
